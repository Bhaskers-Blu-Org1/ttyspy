 * Drop privileges to user specified in configuration when starting ttyspyd
 * Handle partial writes in select() loop: presently we silently discard output
   if either the user's PTY or archive server is slow and only accepts a
   partial write. This can result in corrupted transmissions when a large
   volume of data is transfered.
